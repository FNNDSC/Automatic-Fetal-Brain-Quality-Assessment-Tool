The aim of this project was to develop a Quality Assessment tool for fetal brain MRIs, which is able to score each volume through a deep learning regression model. Developed using Python3 and Keras/Tensorflow framework.

Our network architecture consists of a non-linear configuration, known as Residual Network (ResNet) architecture:

Given that we are dealing with an unbalanced distribution regarding input dataset, we applied different weights to each input class to compensate for the imbalance in the training sample.

### Requirements
* Linux environment
* Python3
* Conda/Anaconda setup

### Installation
1. Create the environment from the conda_environment.yml file:
```python
  conda env create -f conda_environment.yml
```
The first line of the yml file sets the new environment's name.

1.  Activate the new environment: conda activate myenv

1. Verify that the new environment was installed correctly:
```python
  conda env list
```
You can also use conda info --envs
